## How to install
If you simply want to play the game then run the WindowsTerminalPacman.exe file.
If you want to build it yourself then simply use CMake to build it, if you don't know how then look below for help.  

### How to build using CMake
First of all, you need to install CMake, then follow the videos below:  
-https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFXCqKMUZ7Y&t=169s&ab_channel=KeaSigmaDelta for VSCode users.  
-https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqSR0ts5JdQ&ab_channel=CookiezTheDeveloper  for Visual Studio users.  
-https://www.jetbrains.com/help/clion/creating-new-project-from-scratch.html#open-prj for CLion users (Opening a project part).  

Note:
The program may not run correctly in CLion and VSCode's terminal, so you will need to manually open the 'cmake-build-debug' folder and run the .exe file.
